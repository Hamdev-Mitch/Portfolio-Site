            <h3>Development Journey</h3>
            <p>I am a self-taught web developer who was born and raised in Australia. As a teenager I build two computers. I found I was good at the hardware side of computing but was always fascinated by software aspect. I never persued it. Then
              when I was at college I began doing a lot of graphics design and that resparked my interest in working with computers. I eventually ended up doing some online courses, before enrolling in the Front End Web Developer course with RMIT.
              I've used these courses to teach myself how to program.</p>
