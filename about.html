            <h3>My Development Journey</h3>
            <p>I am a self-taught Web Developer who was born and raised in Australia. As a teenager I built two computers. I found I was good at the hardware side of computing but was always fascinated by the software aspect. I never persued it. Then
              when I was at college I began doing a lot of graphics design and that re-sparked my interest in working with computers. I eventually ended up doing some online courses, before enrolling in the Front-End Web Developer course with <a class= "orangeA" href="https://futureskills.rmit.edu.au/front-end-web-developer">RMIT</a>.
              Using these courses I taught myself how to program. I am passionate about learning and pulling things apart to figuring out how they work.</p>
